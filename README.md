## Overview about Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (*NEAT*) ##

This repository contains my seminar paper about Neuroevolution of Augmenting 
Topologies including its LaTeX source code, which intends to give a good 
overview of the current state of research.
Until the paper is done does this README contain interesting potential research
resources.
Feedback welcome.

      > Based on 'Real-time Neuroevolution in the NERO Video Game' (see Conceptual Resources)
      > Check out rtNEAT (real-time NEAT), possibly in the NERO framework
      > Efficient technique, it starts out with a very simple set of behavior and only expands the search space when it is found to be beneficial
      > Difference to other genetic algorithms is that it not only changes the weights of the neural net but also its structure
* [0] 2017, The Year of Neuroevolution: https://medium.com/@moocaholic/2017-the-year-of-neuroevolution-30e59ae8fe18
      > Based on: 'Evolution Strategies as a Scalable Alternative to Reinforcement Learning' (Background Knowledge)
      > Evolution Strategies (ES) can be a strong alternative to Reinforcement Learning (RL) and have a number of advantages like ease of implementation, invariance to the length of the episode and settings with sparse rewards, better exploration behaviour than policy gradient methods, ease to scale in a distributed setting
      > ES scales extremely well with the number of CPUs available demonstrating linear speedups in run time
      > The communication overhead of implementing ES in a distributed setting is lower than for reinforcement learning methods such as policy gradients and Q-learning.
      > The whole history of deep learning is full of re-invention and re-surrection, the main neural network learning algorithm, the backpropagation, was reinvented several times. (http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/who-invented-backpropagation.html)
      > NEAT is a TWEANN (Topology- and Weight-Evolving Artificial Neural Networks)
